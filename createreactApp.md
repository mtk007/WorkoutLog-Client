Create React App
https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app


Create React App is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React.

It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production. Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 10.16 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine. To create a project, run:

npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
